## Relic Details

- A new relic, the "Purified Hand of the Nun", can be found in the Mother of Mothers
- When this item is equipped, the Penitent One gains the ability to perform a double jump
- The double jump ability is restored after:
  - Landing on the ground
  - Grabbing a ladder
  - Grabbing a cliff ledge
  
<br>
Currently (But maybe not in the future) the double jump is not restored after sword climbing on a wall or after an air impulse
